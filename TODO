COSMETIC
* extracting the labels works, but it would be nice to have the returned as 
  something like [male,female] rather than [1,2]. the reason the data are 
  returned the way they are is because it looks like only the factor level 
  is being return... not the actual value. 

FUNCTION
* mutual information calculations on variable importance
* write a reproducibles notebook (knitr)
