#' Microbiome Information 
#' 
#' This library is designed to give researchers in microbial ecology the 
#' ability to easily apply information-theoretic tools to the environmental
#' data. Our code assumes that the community data matrix (OTU) table is 
#' saved in a BIOM format file and a mapping file contains all of the 
#' metadata.
